# Advertising Data Analysis and Prediction

This project analyzes an advertising dataset to understand user behavior and predict whether a user will click on an advertisement based on various features. The dataset includes information such as the time spent on a website, the user's age, area income, daily internet usage, and other demographics.

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to analyze user data and build predictive models to classify whether a user clicked on an ad. The dataset consists of 1000 observations and 10 features including demographic information, online behavior, and ad interaction.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:

| Feature                    | Description                                             | Data Type |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Daily Time Spent on Site**| Time (in minutes) spent by a user on the website daily.  | float64   |
| **Age**                     | Age of the user.                                        | int64     |
| **Area Income**             | Average income of the user's geographical area.         | float64   |
| **Daily Internet Usage**    | Time (in minutes) spent by a user on the internet daily.| float64   |
| **Ad Topic Line**           | The headline of the advertisement.                      | object    |
| **City**                    | The city where the user is located.                     | object    |
| **Male**                    | Gender of the user (1 for male, 0 for female).          | int64     |
| **Country**                 | The country where the user is located.                  | object    |
| **Timestamp**               | Date and time of the user's interaction with the ad.    | object    |
| **Clicked on Ad**           | Whether or not the user clicked on the ad (1 or 0).     | int64     |

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advertising-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and inspect the features:
   ```python
   ad_data = pd.read_csv('advertising.csv')
   ad_data.head()
   ```

2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize patterns and relationships between features.

3. Build machine learning models to predict whether a user will click on the ad, using classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.

## Features
- **Data Visualization**: Understand the data distribution and relationships.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build and evaluate models to predict ad clicks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results
- Predictive models were trained and tested on the dataset. Key findings and model performance metrics will be documented in the analysis section of the notebook.
